# List Editor

A mini app I created where you make a list and add, remove and update items to the list.

I challenged myself to create functions similar to commonly used built-in methods for arrays using only basic syntaxes.

Many of these functions have many parallels to the established methods.

- addLast() --> push(), to add element to the end of an array.
- removeLast() --> pop(), to remove the last element in an array.
- addFirst() --> unshift(), to add element to the start of an array.
- removeFirst() --> shift(), to remove the first element in an array.
- numOfItems --> length, to calculate the number of elements in an array.

Functions exclusive to this app, includes
- find(), to find a specific item in an array.
- reset(), to remove all elements in an array.
